# M-RAP
M-RAP represents the heterogeneous Fog resources as a multilayer graph, partitions it based on the network structure and resource types, and constantly updates it upon dynamic changes in the underlying Fog infrastructure. M-RAP identifies the device partitions for placing the application services according to their resource requirements, which must overlap in the same low-latency network partition.

Two applications deployed on the computing devices and Cloud instances are forked from the following projects:
